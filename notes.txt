LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES - STACKS AND QUEUES:
STACK POINTER ---->     10|next|
                               v
                        2|next |
                               v
                        5|next |
                               v
                      16|next  |
                               v
                      12|next  |
                               v
                              NONE

The Head is called the Stack Pointer and is always pointed to the top of the stack.  There is no tail. Good to think of stacks as actual physical objects that we know, ie. books

Common operations: push, pop, peek, is_empty
PUSH - can only push (add) an item on top of the stack (aka head or stack pointer) - push = O(1)
POP - can only remove an item on top of the stack (aka head...) - pop = O(1)
This mode of operations is known as LIFO - Last In, First Out
PEEK - view the value on top of the stack and peek = O(1)
IS_EMPTY - checks to see if the stack is empty. If the pointer is pointing to an item or None.

QUEUES:
With queues we will be tracking the tails in addition to the head/stack_pointer. To start you will have the head and the tail both pointing to None. If there is an integer then it needs to be converted to a Node. To add you will add it to the tail as in the linked lists.

Queue:
Add Operation = O(1) - Add to the tail
Remove = O(1) - Remove from the head

This mode of operation is FIFO - First In First Out

Remove from Head
Set current to Head - make Head point to current.next - make current.next point to None - Return current.data

When thinking of Queues:
- Queue at cafe - customers form a line, the ones who are in front of the line get served first - in order.
- Queue at customer service - customers who arrive later are served later - in order
- Queue at bank, queue at supermarket cashier, etc.
- When thinking about a queue, think about lines of customers waiting and how they are usually helped.
