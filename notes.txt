LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES - STACKS AND QUEUES:
STACK POINTER ---->     10|next|
                               v
                        2|next |
                               v
                        5|next |
                               v
                      16|next  |
                               v
                      12|next  |
                               v
                              NONE

The Head is called the Stack Pointer and is always pointed to the top of the stack.  There is no tail. Good to think of stacks as actual physical objects that we know, ie. books

Common operations: push, pop, peek, is_empty
PUSH - can only push (add) an item on top of the stack (aka head or stack pointer) - push = O(1)
POP - can only remove an item on top of the stack (aka head...) - pop = O(1)
This mode of operations is known as LIFO - Last In, First Out
PEEK - view the value on top of the stack and peek = O(1)
IS_EMPTY - checks to see if the stack is empty. If the pointer is pointing to an item or None.
